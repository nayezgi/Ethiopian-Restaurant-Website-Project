				<h4>Ethiopian's Traditional Restaurant</h4>
				
				<p>Ethiopian food is one of the most exciting cuisines in the world. Not only is the food 
				extremely unique and extraordinarily flavorful,
                but the food culture that makes up Ethiopia is also something I found truly fascinating.
				One important thing for any visitor to note is the calendar of so-called “fasting days,
				On Wednesdays and Fridays almost everyone eats a vegan diet,
				so those aren’t the best days to find great meat. </p>
				
				<p>This is a list of Ethiopian dishes and foods.
				Ethiopian cuisine characteristically consists of vegetable 
				and often very spicy meat dishes, usually in the form of wat 
				a thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread,
				which is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented
				teff flour. Ethiopians eat exclusively with their right hands,
				using pieces of injera to pick up bites of entrées and side dishes.
				Utensils are rarely used with Ethiopian cuisine. </p>

				<h4>How to eat the Foods</h4>
				
			<p>The very first thing you need to know about Ethiopian food is something called injera.
				Injera is the staple and the most widely consumed starch / filler in all of Ethiopian cuisine;
				Most Ethiopians eat it injera, twice, or even three times a day. It’s the foundation of Ethiopian food.
			</p>

			<p>To begin eating, first tear off a bite sized piece of injera with your right hand.
			   Then use it to scoop up, and pick up a bite of your choice of whatever you have on your platter.
               As you begin to eat your dishes, you can begin to eat the foundation piece of injera at the bottom,
			   and I think it’s the best part of the meal, because it’s had time to soak up all the wonderful flavors of the dishes.
			   No utensils are needed, you eat with your hands, while sharing a single platter of food with everyone you eat with.
			   Eating meals in Ethiopia is absolutely an amazing experience!
