				<h4>A Great Experience</h4>
         <p> A Great Experience. Ate here with a large group of friends recently. The food was tasty, spicy,
		 and filling. It was presented in a traditional style that satisfied everyone involved.
		 A live band played jazz on the stage and they were actually good. I was particularly impressed by 
		 the singer's mean bass lines.The decor was tasteful and comfortable. The only problem we ran into was 
		 that our waitress could not speak English well, so she had to seek assistance from another waitress 
		 whose English was slightly better. This was but a minor annoyance. We all loved the food and ambiance 
		 here and will definitely return in the future.  </p>
				
				<h4>I adore the Injera</h4>
		<p>Haven't been there recently, but their usual standards are very high. I adore the injira bread
		(midway between a crepe and a pancake, and made from teff, an ancient grain not often seen outside Ethiopian cuisine.) 
		If you like spicy and hot foods, this place is definitely worth a try

				<h4>Great Ethiopian food</h4>
				
			<p>We came for Saturday lunch and there was no waiting for seating. 
               We started out with beef and chicken sambusas. I liked the chicken better but both were a little over fried.
               The menu had all the favorites we were expecting. doro wot, shiro wot, misir wot, doro tibs, tana tibs, yeSega tibs, 
			   and tikil gomen. We ordered a meat sampler and a double portion vegetable sampler for 4 adults and it was plenty of food.
			   Plenty of injera was served with the platters. We asked for some extra berbere for sprinkling over our food and they obliged
			</p>
				
					<h4>I love Ethioian Traditional restaurants </h4>
			<p>At church, I first tried Ethiopian food and from the first bite, I knew I needed more. The flavors are so interesting and unique! 
			   I took my friends out to try something new (for them) and we were not disappointed. The waitress kindly explained everything to us (none of us were Ethiopian) and we all enjoyed our food so much we took the leftovers home for the next day!! Lots of vegetarian options as well!
