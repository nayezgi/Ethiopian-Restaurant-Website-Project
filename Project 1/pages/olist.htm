				<h4>Summary </h4>
				<h4> About Buna(coffee)</h4>
			<p> A coffee ceremony (Amharic: ቡና ማፍላት?) is a ritualised form of making and drinking coffee.
				The coffee ceremony is one of the most recognizable parts of Ethiopian culture.
				Coffee is offered when visiting friends, during festivities, or as a daily staple of life. 
				If coffee is politely declined then most likely tea (shai) will be served.
				The ceremony is typically performed by the woman of the household and is considered an honor.
				The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over an open flame in a pan.
				This is followed by the grinding of the beans, traditionally in a wooden mortar and pestle.
				The coffee grounds are then put into a special vessel and boiled.
				After grinding, the coffee is put through a sieve several times.
				The boiling pot (jebena) is usually made of pottery and has a spherical base,
				a neck and pouring spout, and a handle where the neck connects with the base.
				The jebena also has a straw lid

				    <h4>Summary</h4>
				   <h4>About Ambasha</h4>	
				<p>In general,when we talks about fermentation in Ambasha, 
				   it explains how fermentation is taking place in Ambasha.
                   In addition; it gives more details about the recipe. It is very important to follow the direction.
				   Furthermore, you can see women participant in making Ambasha, which you can see clear in the picture.
				   The website has good information and it is very self-explanatory. It is extremely important to follow
				   the direction if you miss one-step the Ambasha does not turn out the way you want. Once the bread is cooked,
				   spread some butter on top of the Ambasha to get a beautiful brown color and give it a good texture.</p>

					<h4>Ambasha versus coffee</h4>

               <P> Ambasha is sometimes used as snack during the ceremoniies.The host pours the coffee for all participants by moving
				the tilted boiling pot over a tray with small, handleless cups from a height of one foot without stop until each cup is full.
				The grounds are brewed three times: the first round of coffee is called awel the second Tona and the third baraka ('to be blessed')
				The coffee ceremony may also include burning of various traditional incense. People add sugar to their coffee, or in the countryside, 
				sometimes salt or traditional butter (see niter kibbeh).The beverage is accompanied by a small snack such as popcorn, peanuts or himbasha.	</p>
