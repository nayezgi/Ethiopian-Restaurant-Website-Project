				<h4>Injera and Wot</h4>
			    <p>Ethiopian traditional Restaurant is found in the center of Harrisburg. 
				   In our restaurant menu you can find some of the most Ethiopian traditional food and drinks as well as excellent restaurant service.
				   The restaurant menu consists of different kinds of traditional foods such as Tere, wot Tibs, Kitfo, Doro Wot, Enjera Firfer,Shiro				Wot and Alecha.
				   These foods are the most common kinds Ethiopian cultural and traditional foods that are found in our restaurant.</p><br/>
				
				<h4> Injera</h4>
				<p>Injera Just like your first kiss, your first taste of injera is an experience you’ll never forget.
				   It’s the national staple and the base of almost every meal. 
				   It is spread out like a large, thin pancake, and food is simply heaped on top of it. 
				   An American tourist is said to have once mistaken it for the tablecloth. Occasionally, injera is served rolled 
				   up beside the food or on a separate plate, looking much like a hot towel on an airplane.<p/> <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.

				<h4>WAT</h4>
				<p>The ubiquitous companion of injera, wat is Ethiopia’s version of curry and can be very spicy – fortunately 
				   the injera helps to temper the heat. In the highlands, bege (lamb) is the most common constituent of wat. 
				   Bure (beef) is encountered in the large towns, and figel (goat) most often in the arid lowlands. Chicken is the king of the wat
				   and doro wat is practically the national dish. Ethiopian Christians as well as Muslims avoid pork. On fasting days,
				   and throughout Lent, meat dishes are avoided and various vegetarian versions of wat are available. Kai wat is a stew of 
				   meat boiled in a spicy (thanks to oodles of berbere) red sauce. Kai sauce is also used for minchet abesh, which is a thick
				   minced-meat stew topped with a hard-boiled egg – it’s one of our favourites, particularly with aib (like dry cottage cheese).
				   Most Ethiopians seem to be under the impression that all foreigners are terrified of spicy food and so, unless you specifically
				   ask for kai wat, you’ll often be served the yellow coloured alicha wat, a much milder, and really rather dull tasting wat.</P>

			<h4>Tella</h4>
			<p>Talla is an Ethiopian home-brewed beer which differs from the others in some respects. 
				First it is brewed with barley or wheat, hops, or spices. Secondly, it has a smoky flavour
				due to the addition of bread darkened by baking and use of a fermentation vessel which has been 
				smoked by inversion over smoldering wood. Talla is not processed under government regulations
				hence the alcohol content varies but is usually around 2% to 4%. Filtered tella has a higher alcohol content ranging from 5% to 6%.</p>

			   <h4>Tere Sega</h4>   
			   <P>Considered something of a luxury in Ethiopia, tere sega (raw meat) is traditionally
				served by the wealthy at weddings and other special occasions. Some restaurants also specialise in it. 
				Not unlike butcher shops in appearance, these places feature carcasses hanging near the entrance
				and men in bloodied overalls brandishing carving knives. The restaurants aren’t as gruesome as they sound:
				the carcass is to demonstrate that the meat is fresh, and the men in overalls to guarantee you get
				the piece you fancy – two assurances you don’t always get in the West. A plate and a sharp knife serve as utensils, 
				and awazi (a kind of  mustard and chilli sauce) and berbere as accompaniments. Served with some local red wine,
				and enjoyed with Ethiopian friends, it’s a ritual not to be missed – at least not for red-blooded meat eaters. 
				It’s sometimes called gored gored.<P/></P> <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/ethiopia/travel-tips-and-articles/ethiopian-food-for-beginners/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d27704a4">Source Refence...</a>
