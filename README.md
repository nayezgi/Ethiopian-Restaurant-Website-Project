# Ethiopian-Restaurant-Website-Project
In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website for a traditional Ethiopian Restaurant that is easily accessible by customers and has multiple functionalities such as search, login, signup, and menu display, gallery. I used HTML to organize the page such as order list. I used CSS to enhance the website aesthetics such as background color, shape, size and such. And I used JavaScript to create interactive elements for the webpage and making the website user friendly.
